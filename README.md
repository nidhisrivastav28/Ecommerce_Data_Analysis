# Ecommerce_Data_Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of an e-commerce dataset using Python's data science libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary objective is to gain insights into various aspects of the e-commerce business and present the findings through visualizations.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Utilizes Pandas for cleaning and organizing the e-commerce dataset.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Performs statistical computations and analysis to understand trends.
- **Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations for better interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib:** Plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

## Project Structure

- **ecommerce_data.csv:** The dataset containing e-commerce data.
- **ecommerce_analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook file for the analysis with step-by-step code and visualizations.
- **README.md:** Project documentation.
